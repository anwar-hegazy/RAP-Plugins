===Downloading===


Well, if you are reading this then you probably already figured out how to download the 
files that are needed.  However, just a reminder, you were provided the opportunity to 
download the software when you purchased the add-on.  You were also added to a membership 
based site so that you can download the latest files at any time.  To access this site 
simply go to rap-tools.com/members.  

If you have purchased multiple products from us then you will have access to the latest 
files for all of the products that you have purchased from this site.



===Unpacking===


When you download the zip that contains all of the files you will have a main directory 
called gis-plugins.  Inside of that folder you will find the install.txt file (this file) 
that is the text version of this chapter with installation instructions.  You will also 
find a directory called GIS.  Inside of GIS is a directory called themes.



===Uploading===


It is important to understand how RAP needs to see add-ons for them to work properly.  
Every add-on needs to be placed in a special directory under the rap_admin directory.  
You need to upload the files for the Themes addon to these directories.



Under the rap_admin directory there is a directory called addons.  Inside of addons there 
is a directory for every company that makes an addon and inside of each of those directories
is a directory for each addon.



So the contents that are in GIS/themes in the archive file need to go into the 
rap_admin/addons/GIS/themes directory in your installation of RAP.  

I am assuming that you 
already have the knowledge on how to upload the files to your site.
