	<br></br><p>Welcome To Rap Tools, the swiss army knife for RAP.</p><br></br>
	<p>Rap tools came about when I invested in RAP and started moving my sites to the RAP model.  Prior to RAP I had a mess of different software like amember, idevaffilitae, direct paypal integration, butterfly marketing script and that is just what I can name off of the top of my head.</p><br></br>
	<p>In the process of moving all my sites to RAP there were a few things missing and so then began my journey to create addon to fill in the gaps.</p><br></br>
	<p>There are a few "little" things that I could not justify creating a whole addon for so I just started adding the features into a single addon that had lots of little features and tools.</p><br></br>
	<p>That was the birth of this Rap Tools Addon.  As I come across more little things they will be added to this addon.</p><br></br>
	<p class="subhead-medium">Using Rap Tools</p><br></br>
	<p>I have separated the Rap Tools menu into major sections that are indicated by the menu above.  Select the Menu item above and this area right here will change to the options for the area you select.</p><br></br>
